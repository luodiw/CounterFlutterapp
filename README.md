# counterapp1

This is an edited version of the initial Flutter counter app.

# Idea

This is to add some more basic features allowing the user to add increments and decrease increments back to 0 as a reset features.

# Further Implementations

There are 2 main versions of this app: one in main.dart and the other in main2.dart showing 2 different approaches to the reset counter app. I believe the 2nd version is a cleaner, more refined than the initial code given by Flutter.

# Themes (Bacgkround)

This app is curated to support both dark and light thematics for the Counter app, supported by the system app manager.

# Visual Effects

The key visual effect is to add physical bouncing element to the numbers while they are being incremented and decremented.

# Challenges

One of the key challenges were the changing syntaxes of the Flutter environment, and as a new developer to Dart, there are many concepts that are different and quite new for mobile app devlopment as to compiling languages, data queries, ML, or Python. In addtion, making these coded features to appear in the Simulator App was a difficulty as well. Unfortunately, some of the added features may not show up because of some system problem I couldn't yet figure out.

But, designing a new interface and adding some fun features to the Counter app is always a fun project to work on.
